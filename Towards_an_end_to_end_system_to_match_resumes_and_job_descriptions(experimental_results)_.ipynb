For Risk Based \\nCapital (RBC), Credit Usage \\n(CU) and Stress Test (ST), the methodologies that will be used for repo \\nstyle transactions are \\nSimple VaR if the collateral is eligible.

It is a proprietary platform \\nand has company internal \\ncustomers. It has main two planes, system management and system service \\nplanes and several \\nsub modules. \\nI have successfully worked on the following modules. \\n \\nModule - MML INI Parser Tool \\nMML is Configuration Tool used in communication equipments \\nThis Configuration Tool has set of default and user defined commands. INI \\nParsing tool is a tool \\nwhich accepts MML Commands in certain grammar and generates Resource file \\nand Binary File \\nrespectively which will be read by server to resister the commands. \\nInvolved in the development, testing, verification of the module on \\nwindows. \\n \\n \\n \\nModule - Man Machine Language \\nMML is a configuration tool widely used in communication equipments. It \\nuses Client/Server \\narchitecture. MML server communicates with both the client and the APP in \\nthe equipment. \\nIt receives MML commands inputted by users from the client and relays it \\nto APP to process \\nit. After acquiring the processing result, the server generates a MML \\nreport and sends it back \\nto the client. It interacts with other system modules. Connection \\nManagement, Authorization \\nManagement, Command Process, Data Synchronization, Event Notification, \\nCommand Parsing, \\nLOG/ALARM Handling are some of the functions of MML Server. \\nInvolved in the development, defect fixing and verification of the module \\non windows, Linux and \\nvxworks platforms Involved in several release activities. \\n \\nModule - Configuration Management \\nConfiguration Management Module is core module of System Management. Its \\nmain function \\nis to define specifications for configuration management interface \\nbetween the configuration \\ntool layer and the application layer, and provide related configuration \\ncommand communication \\nmechanism. Any information that can be modified by the user/application \\nand that affects the \\nfunctionality of the application can be regarded as configurable data. \\nAll configuration commands \\ncan be sent to Configuration Management Module using a common interface \\ntype. \\nConfiguration Data Management Module is a supplementary optional \\ncomponent that can be \\nloaded to provide a persistent storage (&amp; retrieval) mechanism for \\napplications' static \\nconfiguration data. \\nInvolved in the defect fixing and feature enhancement of the module on \\nwindows, Linux and \\nvxworks platforms Involved in several release activities. \\n \\nModule - TL1 \\n\\n\\fTransaction Language 1 (TL1) is a widely used, \\\"legacy\\\", management \\nprotocol in \\ntelecommunications. It is a cross-vendor, cross-technology man-machine \\nlanguage, and is \\nwidely used to manage Synchronous Optical Networks (SONET) . It is \\ndefined for operation \\nsystem/ network element (machine-to-machine) interfaces. TL1 corresponds \\nto the User System \\nLanguage (USL), which is the language for human-to machine interactions. \\nIt is used for managing \\nnetwork elements in a network. TL1 Module is an interface between an \\nApplication and Client. \\nClient sends the TL1 Commands to perform some configuration operations in \\nthe Applications. \\nTL1 module process the client text TL1 commands according to standard \\nspecification TL1 GR \\n831 and interacts with the Configuration management module and Convert \\nResponse messages \\nback to TL1 Response messages \\nInvolved in development, verification and customer and release \\nactivities. I was a module lead \\nfor this project. \\n \\nModule - QX \\nThe Qx interface is a company proprietary application layer protocol \\nbetween target and the GUI \\nof NMS. By this protocol, NE can communicate with SCC (System \\nCommunication and Control) \\nsoftware in different operation system. Each command has defined format. \\nCommands are given \\nin binary form. Qx Module acts as an interface between the Client and \\nApplication. \\nInvolved in development, verification and customer and release \\nactivities. I was a module lead \\nfor this project. \\n \\nRole: Designer/Developer/ Reviewer/ \\n \\n \\n \\nResponsibility: Designing and coding various modules Involvement in peer \\nreview and overall \\nreview activities and project discussions Coordinating the development \\ncycle Training team \\nmembers and solving project related issues configuration management of \\nthe project using Clear \\nCase \\nDuration: From June 2004 to Sep 2006 \\nHardware: X86, CPCI, ATCA \\nSoftware: C++, C \\nProject2: Wireless LAN - 802.11 MAC (Split AP Architecture) \\nDescription of the project \\nWireless LAN 802.11 describes MAC and PHY. Wireless stations are \\nconnected to form a basic \\nservice area which is controlled by a base station called Access Point. \\nAccess Point is a special \\ndevice which basically acts as a bridge between wired and wireless media \\nconnected to a \\ndistributed system generally Ethernet. Several Access Points can be \\nconnected to a distribution \\n\\n\\fmedia to form an extended service set. \\nIn split AP architecture AP's connect to a central controller called \\nAccess Controller in short \\nAC. AP has the minimal functionalities such as receiving the 802.11 data \\nfrom the radio and \\nforwarding data and management frames to AC, Power management, \\nAdvertising beacons, \\nhandling control frames. Management operations such as Association, \\nAuthentication, Handling \\nframes, conversion between [\\u2026] 802.3 will be done by AC. \\nI was involved in the development of feature development, defect \\nanalysis, testing activities in \\nthe CLI, Frame handling, Association and Beacon advertisement modules. \\nModule: WLAN Support for WMM 802.11 E Qos Requirements \\nWMM is a protocol designed by the Wi-Fi forum to provide quality of \\nservice to wireless traffic. \\nThis project basically deals with providing WLAN support for WMM module, \\nthis includes handling \\nQos frames in the Uplink down link data flow, Priority mapping for Qos \\nframes, Fragmentation \\nand Reassembly of the Qos frames, Security Related modifications for Qos \\nFrames, Power \\nmanagement of Qos stations etc. \\nI was involved in the design, review, coding of the Uplink, Down link \\nData Flow, Fragmentation \\nand Reassembly of the Qos frames. \\n \\nRole: Developer \\nResponsibility: To design, and code the necessary changes.

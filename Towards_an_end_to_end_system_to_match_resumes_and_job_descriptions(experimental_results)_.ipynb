WAAS combines \\nCisco's Wide Area \\nFile Services (WAFS-products allow remote office users to access and \\nshare files globally at \\nLAN speeds over the WAN) with WAN optimization inside of a router, \\naccelerating TCP-based \\napplications on a given network. \\n\\u2022 WAAS system consists of a set of devices called wide area application \\nengines (WAEs) that work \\ntogether to optimize TCP traffic over your network. When client and \\nserver applications attempt \\n \\n \\n \\nto communicate with each other, the network intercepts and redirects this \\ntraffic to the WAEs so \\nthat they can act on behalf of the client application and the destination \\nserver. \\n\\u2022 The WAEs examine the traffic and use built-in application policies to \\ndetermine whether to \\noptimize the traffic or allow it to pass through your network un \\noptimized \\n\\u2022 Mainly involves optimizing the various Ao's like HTTP, SSL, HTTPS and \\nfunctional wise platform \\ncheck. \\n \\nPRODUCT WAAS(Wide Area Application Services) \\n \\nEDUCATION \\n \\nB.E in CSE \\n \\nANNA University \\n \\n2011 \\n \\nDay Adventist Matric Hr.Sec School \\n \\n2005 to 2007 \\n \\nSKILLS \\n \\noptimization (2 years), Python (4 years), router (4 years), TCL (4 \\nyears), Testing (4 years) \\n \\n\\n\\fADDITIONAL INFORMATION \\n \\nTechnical Skills \\nProgramming Languages Python, TCL, Power Query, SQL, Shell Scripting, C# \\nConcepts Networking, WAAS (Wan Optimization), WAAS on Router, WAE(Wide \\nArea Engine), \\nWCCP Protocol, \\nAutomation Framework ATS (Automated Test System), Selenium Testing \\nFramework \\nIDE(Integrated Development Environment) Eclipse, Pycharm, Pydev[Plugin \\nfor eclipse IDE] \\nSoftware \\nEclipse CDETS & Rally (Bug Tracking), eARMS (Regression testing), \\nACME(Versioning), \\nTIMS(Reporting), HTMLTestRunner, Power Query(Automation), ARAS \\nPLM(Product Lifecycle \\nManagement), AML Studio (adaptive markup language) \\n \\nOperating Systems Windows XP/10, Linux \\n\\n\\f\"\n",
